# TODO
To anyone looking at this I'm having trouble getting ENS names from Ethereum provider using `ethers` -> `JsonRpcProvider` -> `lookupAddress`.
It only works with `Web3Provider` aka the web3 wallet like metamask. I need to get ENS name directly from `JsonRpcProvider` maybe via making the raw request myself but not sure how atm. It would be cool if anyone can help :)

- Also in the final product there will be a settings page to change, add readonly json rpc providers. So users can choose to use different providers or their own local node etc.
