# TODO
- Also in the final product there will be a settings page to change, add readonly json rpc providers. So users can choose to use different providers or their own local node etc.
- IMPORTANT, client side AI with TensorFlow.js or similar, that classifys images. maybe text later too. And blur the nsfw content based on the user configuration.
